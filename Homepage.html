<h3> Communication </h3>
<p>Positive communication is about making the time to listen to each other, 
listening without judgment,
 and being open to expressing your own thoughts and feelings.
 When you have positive communication in your family, it helps everybody feel understood,
 respected and valued, and this strengthens your relationships.

</p>

<p> 
Not all communication happens in words, so itâ€™s important to pay attention to the 
feelings that your children and partner express non-verbally. 
For example, your teenage child might not want to talk to you but might 
still come looking for the comfort of cuddles sometimes!
